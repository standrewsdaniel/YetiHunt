# YetiHunt
Instatiates a 31 x 31 board that simulates 3 teams of hunters looking for a cryptid in the woods.

Features and functionality:

If one of the teams finds the cryptid, they win, but if the cryptid can make it all the way across the board without being found, it wins.

The cryptid is able to be chosen by the user from 3 choices, and each one has different movement types and chances of generating a sound that will cause the teams to move towards it.
The wendigo moves silently, but only one space at a time.
The sasquatch and yeti are the same, and move two spaces at a time, but the yeti has a higher chance of breaking a stick and making a sound than the sasquatch does. 

The movement is random, so the outcome varies every time the program is ran.

The board is drawn in the console at the conclusion of the game so the user can visualize the path that both the hunters and the cryptid took across the board and how they either won or lost.
